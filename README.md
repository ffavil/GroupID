Ramon hates possums becuase one ate his parrot.
His parot was a starry eyed little bird.
The parrot was named ROB, 
and rob didnt believe in dreams.
And now he found a baby raccoon
and named it Fiona. 
But Rob was allergic to Fiona, and couldnt stand her presence.
Therefore, rob and fiona decided to go on a date and fell in love.
Two weeks later, they got married and lived happily ever after.
